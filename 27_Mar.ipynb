        "\n",
        "**Choosing the Better Performer**:\n",
        "- **Context Dependent**: The choice between RMSE and MAE depends on the context and the importance of outliers. RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily, so if outliers are important, RMSE might be preferable. If you want a more robust measure that is less sensitive to outliers, MAE might be better.\n",

Model A uses Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model B uses Lasso regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.5. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any trade-offs or limitations to your choice of regularization method?\n",

        "- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate both models using appropriate performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, or \\(R^2\\).\n",
        "- **Feature Selection**: If feature selection is important, Model B (Lasso) might be preferable since it can shrink some coefficients to zero.\n",
        "- **Multicollinearity**: If multicollinearity is a concern, Model A (Ridge) might perform better as it is effective in handling correlated predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Trade-offs and Limitations**:\n",
        "- **Complexity**: Choosing the right regularization parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) is crucial and can be complex.\n",
        "- **Interpretability**: Lasso might result in a simpler model with fewer predictors, making it more interpretable, whereas Ridge retains all predictors but shrinks their coefficients.\n",
        "- **Model Performance**: Lasso might perform poorly if the true model includes all predictors, as it may erroneously shrink some to zero. Ridge maintains all predictors but might not perform as well if only a few predictors are truly relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the choice depends on the specific context, the nature of the data, and the importance of feature selection versus handling multicollinearity."
