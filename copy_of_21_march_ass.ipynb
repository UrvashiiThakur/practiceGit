        "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data, but they have different purposes and use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoding: This method assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable without considering any ordinal relationship. It is typically used when there is no inherent order in the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal Encoding: This method assigns numerical values to categories based on a defined order or hierarchy. It is used when the categories have a meaningful order or ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoding: Converting categories like \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\" into 0, 1, 2 respectively without any particular order.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal Encoding: Converting categories like \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\" into 0, 1, 2 respectively, where the order signifies increasing size.\n",
        "When to choose which:\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoding: Use when categories do not have a natural order. E.g., Gender (Male, Female).\n",
