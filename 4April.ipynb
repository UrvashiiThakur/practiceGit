        "\n",
        "A **Decision Tree Classifier** is a machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**:\n",
        "1. **Root Node**: The process starts with the entire dataset and selects the best feature to split the data based on a certain criterion (like Gini impurity or entropy).\n",
        "2. **Splitting**: The dataset is split into subsets where each subset contains data points with similar values for the selected feature.\n",
        "3. **Recursive Splitting**: This process is recursively applied to each subset. The best feature is selected at each step, and new nodes are created.\n",
        "4. **Leaf Nodes**: When a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per node), the node becomes a leaf node. Leaf nodes represent the final predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prediction**:\n",
        "- To make a prediction for a new instance, the instance is passed through the tree, starting from the root. Based on the feature values, it moves through the nodes until it reaches a leaf node. The value or class at the leaf node is the prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Splitting Criterion**: The core idea is to select splits that best separate the classes. Common criteria include:\n",
        "   - **Gini Impurity**: Measures the frequency of different classes in the node. Lower Gini impurity indicates a purer node.\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     Gini = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "     where \\( p_i \\) is the probability of class \\( i \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Entropy**: Measures the amount of information disorder or randomness in the node.\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     Entropy = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\log_2(p_i)\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Information Gain**: Used to determine the best feature for splitting the data.\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{Information Gain} = \\text{Entropy(parent)} - \\left( \\sum \\frac{n_i}{n} \\times \\text{Entropy}(child_i) \\right)\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "   where \\( n_i \\) is the number of instances in the child node and \\( n \\) is the number of instances in the parent node.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Recursive Splitting**: The algorithm recursively applies the splitting criterion to each subset of data, forming a tree structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stopping Criteria**: The recursion stops when a predefined stopping criterion is met, such as maximum depth or minimum samples per node.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Decision Tree Classifier** for binary classification splits the data into two classes at each node. The steps are:\n",
        "1. **Initial Split**: The root node contains the entire dataset.\n",
        "2. **Feature Selection**: The best feature is selected based on the chosen criterion (Gini or entropy).\n",
        "3. **Binary Splits**: The data is split into two subsets based on the feature.\n",
        "4. **Recursive Process**: This process is repeated for each subset until stopping criteria are met.\n",
        "5. **Prediction**: New instances are classified by traversing the tree according to their feature values until reaching a leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Geometric Intuition**:\n",
        "- Decision trees partition the feature space into rectangular regions. Each internal node splits the space using a threshold on a feature.\n",
        "- In a 2D feature space, each split is a vertical or horizontal line that divides the space into two halves.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Making Predictions**:\n",
        "- For a new data point, you start at the root node and move through the tree according to the feature values, determining which side of the split the point falls on.\n",
        "- This continues until a leaf node is reached, which contains the predicted class or value.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Example**: Disease Screening\n",
        "- **Importance of Recall**: In disease screening, recall is crucial to ensure that all cases of the disease are detected (minimizing false negatives), even if it means having some false positives. Missing a disease diagnosis can have severe consequences for the patient.\n",
