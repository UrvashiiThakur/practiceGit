        "### Q1. Write a code to print the data present in the second row of the dataframe, df.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "course_name = ['Data Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Data Engineer']\n",

        "print(df.iloc[1])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **loc**: Accesses rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. It is label-based, meaning that you have to specify the name of the rows and columns that you need to filter out.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **iloc**: Accesses rows and columns by integer position(s). It is position-based, meaning that you have to specify the position of the rows and columns that you need to filter out.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. Reindex the given dataframe using a variable, reindex = [3,0,1,2] and store it in the variable, new_df then find the output for both new_df.loc[2] and new_df.iloc[2].\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "reindex = [3, 0, 1, 2]\n",
